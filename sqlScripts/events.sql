Everything from the 23 year-old''s Harlem upbringing to his iconic namesake – his mother named him Rakim in honor of the legendary Queens-based lyricist – is steeped in the storied history of rap music''s birthplace and proving grounds. However, the most impressive characteristic of Rocky''s sound is his integration of codeine-soaked southern rap influences such as UGK and 36 Mafia into the grandiose wordplay and aesthetic memorably espoused by the reign of Harlem''s Dipset collective. Far from traditional East Coast elitism, the distinctive drawls of the Houston, Memphis, and Atlanta rap scenes can be heard echoing throughout his celebrated debut mixtape LiveLoveASAP, most notably in the plethora of tracks crafted by burgeoning producer Clams Casino. Rocky''s stunning chemistry with the young producer''s gorgeously emotive yet banging compositions undoubtedly aided in securing both a $3 million record deal with RCA and a spot performing on Drake''s "Club Paradise" tour. Now, Rocky is working to promote his A$AP Mob affiliates, a hyped and intriguingly talented amorphous collective of artists that includes A$AP Ty Beats, the producer responsible for Rocky''s star-making hit "Peso." Drawing from multiple sources by claiming to be ''inspired by everyone in music'' like only an internet-age kid can, and already working with the best, the A$AP Rocky show comes highly tipped for good reason.\n\n______\n\nA$AP Rocky a vu le jour au cœur-même du hip-hop. Depuis sa naissance, ce genre bat dans sa chair au rythme de la musique. Tout en ce jeune de Harlem, de son instruction jusqu''à son nom iconique – sa mère lui ayant donné le prénom de Rakim en l''honneur du légendaire parolier du Queens –, est imprégné de l''histoire de ce quartier où le rap est né et a évolué. Ce qui rend cependant le son de Rocky unique, c''est le mélange des caractéristiques du « southern rap », imbibé de codéine tout comme que les compositions d''UGK et de 36 Mafia, au lyrisme et à l''esthétisme propres au règne de l''iconique collectif Dipset, également issu de Harlem. À mille lieues du son élitiste du rap de la côte Est, les voix traînantes des scènes de Houston, de Memphis et d''Atlanta résonnent se font écho sur la très acclamée première mixtape du jeune de 23 ans, LiveLoveASAP, comme en témoignent les pièces élaborées par Clams Casino. L''alliance foudroyante entre Rocky et ce jeune producteur émérite aux bangers profonds bien que délicatement émouvants leur a permis de signer un contrat de 3 millions avec RCA, ainsi que de leur valoir une place sur scène aux côtés de Drake lors de sa tournée « Club Paradise ». À l''heure actuelle, Rocky se consacre à la promotion de ses partenaires d''A$AP Mob, un intriguant collectif d''artistes hétérogènes, énergiques et talentueux incluant A$AP Ty Beats, le producteur derrière le hit « Peso », qui a valu à Rocky ses lettres de noblesse. Se laissant « influencer par tout le monde de la musique » comme seul un enfant ayant grandi connecté à l''Internet peut l''être, tout en puisant son inspiration des grands noms avec lesquels il collabore, ce n''est pas sans raison qu''A$AP Rocky se retrouve à la tête d''un spectacle aussi attendu et respecté.\n\n\nwww.lookoutpresents.com\nwww.evenko.ca\nwww.greenland.ca', 0),
